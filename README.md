# Credit_Default_project

**Overview**

Banking / Financial Institutes plays a significant role in providing financial service.
To maintain the integrity, bank/institute must be careful when investing in customers to avoid
financial loss.

Before giving credit to borrowers, the bank must come to know about the potential of customers.
The model we built here will use all possible factors to predict data on customers to find who are  defaulters and non-defaulters next month.

The goal is to find the whether the clients are able to pay their next month credit amount.
Identify some potential customers for the bank who can settle their credit balance.
To determine if their customers could make the credit card payments on-time.
Default is the failure to pay interest or principal on a loan or credit card payment.
